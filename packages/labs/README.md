# Lit Labs

An experimental playground for Lit helpers and tools. Your mileage may vary.

## Overview

The APIs, modules, and libraries available in labs represent features that
should be generally useful but are not yet ready for inclusion in the
core Lit library for various reasons. They are published via the labs package
primarily to gather user feedback.

These features may change significantly and frequently, or they may be
removed altogether. In some cases, when a feature stabilizes and proves to be
useful, it may move into the core Lit library.

## Installation

From inside your project folder, run:

```bash
$ npm install lit-labs
```

## Supported Browsers

The last 2 versions of all modern browsers are supported, including
Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, Edge. In addition, Internet Explorer 11 is also supported.

Edge and Internet Explorer 11 require the web components polyfills.
